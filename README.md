Test Automation Assignment

### The main Frameworks included in the project:
* Selenium Webdriver
* Rest-Assured
* TestNG
* Allure Report
* Extent Reports
* Apachi POI

### Design implementation:
* Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
* Data Driven framework
* Have a supporting Utilities package in *src/main/java* file path, named ***"Utils"*** that includes utility classes and many wrapper methods which services as the core engine for the project 

### How to execute the test cases locally:
#### Setup
* Import or clone the maven project on any java IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ for example)
* A properties file ***"configurations.properties"*** can be found it *src/main/resources* file path including all the configurations needed in the execution (make sure that the "execution.type" property is "Local" if you need to execute locally)
#### For GUI PHPTRAVELS Test Cases: 
* A properties file ***"phptravels.properties"*** can be found it *src/main/resources* file path including all the configurations/global test data needed in the execution for the tests
* Can find the test cases in the *src/test/java* folder inside the *phptravels.gui.tests* package "JsonPlaceholderTests"
#### For APIs Jsonplaceholder Test Cases:
* A properties file ***"jsonplaceholder.properties"*** can be found it *src/main/resources* file path including all the configurations/global test data needed in the execution for the tests
* Can find the test cases in the *src/test/java* folder inside the *jsonplaceholder.api.tests* package "AdminUserTests"
#### Execution
* Can execute each class sperately
* Or an find the test suite xml file in the *src/test/resources* folder inside the *TestSuites* folder; To start executing the test classes, you can right click on the FullExecution.xml* folder and then click "Run As" > "TestNG Suite"
#### Reporting
* After executing, you can easily generate the ***Allure Report*** by opening a commandline terminal on the project root path and type `mvn allure:serve` (needs to be able to execute mvn commands); Or you can find the Extent Report ***ExtentReports.html*** in the project root path for the latest execution

### How to see the execution and the test report from the GitHub Actions:
* Click on the *"Actions"* tab 
* Click on the latest workflow run link 
* Click on "Test on Ubuntu" and open "Run tests - Chrome Headless" to see the execution logs
* And you can check the execution reports by clicking on "ExtentReport" and/or "Allure Report" in the *Artifacts* section (Just download, unzip and open it)
